Comment: Hummm... Second EO I tried. Found this DR without even planning on using it, just solving the cube to scramble it again in order to check another EO. I saw that everything got solved. Wrote it down. 55 minutes left. Laughed. This was CR by 2 moves. Hesitated a bit. Checked the solution over and over for a few minutes. Laughed a bit more. Said to myself "whatever" and handed in at 9 minutes. "A 20 in 9 minutes is much better than super low chances of a sub20 in an hour with extremely high chances of just wasting time here", thought the Trainee to himself, and so he left.
Do I care if there is a findable 19 or 18? No. I don't want to murder my FMC single so quickly!
