(23, 27, 26) = 25.33 mo3, Argentinian Champion
Overall comment: A very bad mean, but actually excellent given, once again, the conditions I did it under, and the time and effort I devoted for every scramble.
Happy to be South American and National Champion now, as well as double SAR holder :)

Comment: First thing I found, only DR I checked. Handed in at 10-15 minutes to save up brain power for the rest of the long day. Happy with this since the scramble sucked.

Comment: Any finish off the first DR I found. Took about 30 minutes or a bit less. Again, saving brain for MBLD. Don't care about the result, a sub30 is enough for the streak.

Recap: Feels super weird to be able to get this mean which would still be non-Guido SAR, with minimal effort. I got a bit lucky on A1, otherwise this would have been a +26 mo3. For scramble 2 I just wanted to get freed up rapidly, since I had a 28 cube multi incoming. For scramble 3, I just did badly I guess.
