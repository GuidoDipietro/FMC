### Everything I have about FMC.  
- All my solutions
- Some 'theory' that I found useful at some moment
- Data visualization programs in Python

# Main folders and files

## _FMC.txt
All my solutions.

## programs 
Some programs in Python that compute stats and stuff.
The ones I use the most:
- **histoplotter.py**  
  Plots a histogram of all solutions + latest 100 + latest 50. You can easily modify the value of both 'latest's.  
  Also displays some other brief stats.
- **histoplotter_100.py**  
  Same as histoplotter but only latest 100 and 50. Also customizable.
- **mo3s.py**  
  Frequency plot of all rolling mo3s in the latest 100 solutions.
- **worst_of_X.py**  
  Mean of worst solution (and 2nd and 3rd worst) by chunks. Partition and scan stats. Customizable sizes.
  
## solutions
Some solutions I found especially nice (PBs / interesting solutions), both mine and foreign.
Also reconstructions of all my official FMC attempts (except World's 46).

## theory stuff
Things I noticed or found worth pointing out. Some are algorithms, some are ways to solve certain cases, etc.

## AllMySub30s.txt
All my solutions that are under 30 moves. Legacy file from when sub30s were rare, I just keep it updated as a tradition.
