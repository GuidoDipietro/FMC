R' U' F B2 D' R2 D' U2 B2 D2 U' B2 F2 L2 B' U' L U R2 D R2 B2 U' F R' U' F

(D F' B2 D') //EO
(R' F' D2 B' R' B' R') //DR (11) dc

I can do:
F R2 to setup
F L2 to setup
then solve as you know

this case: setup F R2 U2
can be solved as
U2 R2 F
D2 L2 B

gives a total of like 16 different HTRs to try i think
my dumbass didn't try F L2 type setups xd
